from django.test import TestCase

# The 'preinscripcion' app's models.py is empty, so no tests can be written for it.

# If models were present, the structure would be similar to other app tests:
#
# from ..models import YourModel
#
# class YourModelTests(TestCase):
#     def test_your_model_creation(self):
#         # Create mock dependencies
#         mock_dependency = MagicMock()
#         mock_dependency.pk = 1
#
#         # Instantiate your model
#         instance = YourModel(field1="value1", foreign_key_field=mock_dependency)
#
#         # Assertions
#         self.assertIsInstance(instance, YourModel)
#         self.assertEqual(instance.field1, "value1")
#         self.assertEqual(instance.foreign_key_field, mock_dependency)
#         # Add more assertions for other fields and methods

# Note: In a real Django project, you would import the actual models and use
# Django's test client and database for more robust testing.
